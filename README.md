Spam Filter Using Regular Expressions

This project is a web application built with React that allows users to check if their messages might be flagged as spam. It utilizes the power of regular expressions (Regex) to scan messages for patterns commonly associated with spam, such as requests for money, offers of free rewards, or suspicious phrases. The app features a clean, modern UI with responsive design, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

Upon entering a message, users can instantly see whether it matches any predefined spam patterns. The application uses a set of regular expressions to detect suspicious keywords or phrases, such as "free money," "please help," or "dear friend." If a message matches any of these patterns, it is flagged as spam; otherwise, it is considered safe.

The project not only demonstrates the practical use of regular expressions for real-world problem-solving but also highlights best practices in web development, including responsive design, interactive forms, and state management using React.

Key Features:

Spam detection using powerful regular expressions.
Responsive design for optimal display on all screen sizes.
Interactive user interface with instant feedback on message status.
Modern design with clean typography and smooth interactions.
Technologies Used:

Frontend: React, JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3.
Core Logic: Regular Expressions (Regex).
This project is perfect for anyone looking to understand the practical applications of Regex while appreciating good UI/UX design principles.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
